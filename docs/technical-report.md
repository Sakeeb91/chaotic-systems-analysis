# Technical Report: Chaotic Systems Analysis

## Executive Summary

This technical report presents a comprehensive analysis of chaotic dynamical systems using advanced mathematical and computational techniques. Our implementation focuses on the Rössler system through rigorous application of chaos theory, fractal analysis, and phase space reconstruction methods.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Dynamical Systems Theory

The study of chaotic systems requires understanding of nonlinear dynamical systems described by:

```
dx/dt = f(x, μ)
```

Where x represents the state vector and μ contains system parameters.

### Rössler System

Our primary focus is the Rössler system, defined by:

```
dx/dt = -y - z
dy/dt = x + ay  
dz/dt = b + z(x - c)
```

With standard chaotic parameters: a = 0.2, b = 0.2, c = 5.7

## Phase Space Reconstruction

### Takens' Embedding Theorem

Reconstruction of the attractor from scalar time series using delay coordinates:

```
Y(t) = [x(t), x(t+τ), x(t+2τ), ..., x(t+(m-1)τ)]
```

### Parameter Selection

- **Embedding Dimension (m)**: Determined using false nearest neighbors analysis
- **Delay Time (τ)**: Optimized using mutual information minimization
- **Statistical Validation**: Bootstrap confidence intervals

## Fractal Analysis

### Correlation Dimension

Implementation of the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm:

```
C(r) = lim(N→∞) (2/N(N-1)) Σ Θ(r - |Xi - Xj|)
```

The correlation dimension is estimated from the scaling region:

```
D₂ = d log C(r) / d log r
```

### Computational Methods

- Efficient distance matrix computation using NumPy
- Adaptive radius selection for optimal scaling
- Statistical convergence testing

## Results and Analysis
